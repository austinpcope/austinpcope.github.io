			About me 

		</div>

		<div class="about-text">

			<p> I'm a freelance writer, journalist, and audio producer currently based in New York City. My stories span the intersections between politics, the environment, infrastructure, media, and history. </p>

			<p> I'm from rural southwestern Colorado and have lived, worked, and studied in Belgium, Ohio, Spain, Wyoming, and northern India. I got my start in professional journalism as a community radio host and reporter at  <a href="https://www.ksjd.org/" style= "text-decoration:underline;"> KSJD Radio </a> in my hometown of Cortez. Since then, I've produced hundreds of local interviews, dozens of spot and feature stories, and several long-form articles and audio productions. You can find a full list of my work for KSJD <a href="https://www.ksjd.org/people/austin-cope" style="color:#000000;text-decoration:underline; font-size: 18px"> here</a> and my full portfolio below. </p> 


			<p> In addition to English, I speak French, Spanish, and Hindi. Between 2018 and 2020, I was an Oberlin Shansi Memorial Association fellow, where I worked with <a href="https://www.jagorirural.org/" style="color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;"> Jagori Rural Charitable Trust</a>, a grassroots organization in Himachal Pradesh, India promoting sustainable agriculture and gender equity. I have a degree in Politics from Oberlin College in Ohio, and I am currently studying international reporting at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York. </p>

						<p> It took only a few minutes for Montezuma-Cortez school board member Lance McDaniel to type, “I’m Antifa,” select a background with orange flames and post to Facebook from his iPhone in early June 2020. It was about a week after George Floyd’s murder, and he was upset. </p>

						<p> “I was basically just saying I was anti-fascist,” the 65-year-old McDaniel told me the following summer at a Mexican restaurant in Cortez, Colo., the city with a population of about 8,700 where we both grew up. </p>
